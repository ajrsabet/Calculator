// 3. Calculator
// Create a program that functions as a calculator. 
// The program stores each user input one at a time until an "=" sign is input. 
// At which point the values input should be processed as a calculator would. 
// 1000 + 5 * 3 =
// Assume this is input one at a time. [1,0,0,0,"+",5,"*",3,"="] 

// Order of operations must be considered. Parenthesis and Exponents need not be handled nor do you have to handle decimals. 
// Major Extra credit if you handle the PE in PEMDAS and add decimals.

// Values it must handle. 
// [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,"+","-","/","*","="]
